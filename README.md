<h1>Description:<br></h1> 
This is my take home interview assignment for the Full-Stack Web Developer - Entry Level position at Aston Technologies Inc.<br> 
<h2>Objective<br></h2>
Given a pdf image of a generic webpage, recreate the page using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br> 


<h2>Techniques Applied</h2>
1. Bootstrap 5 Framework.<br> 
2. The box model and container classes.<br>
3. relative and absolute positioning.<br> 
4. Media Queries.<br> 
5. Dynamic sizing.<br>
6. CSS styling.<br>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
I learned a lot while working on this project. Taking the knowledge that I learned in some of my coursera courses, I thought that using Bootstrap would make positioning elements easier. My one hicccup though was that in my course, we learned on Bootstrap 3/4 and Bootstrap 5 is slightly different syntactically. I wanted to challenge myself by importing and using Bootstrap 5 for this project to show that I can import and use a framework that I'm not completely comfortable in. After realizing this and making adjustments, my project went a lot smoother! I've also become very aware of how difficult and tedious it is to place elements on a page when all you have for reference is an image. I know that this is common practice in a real work environment where technologies like Figma and sketches/screenshots from designers are commonly used to get from the ideation stage to a working project so it was interesting, challenging, and fun to take an image and turn it into an actual web page! I know that my project isn't 100% perfect and I also know that there are definitely better and more efficient ways to get my project looking exactly like the image given to me, but I'm eager and excited to learn more those in the future!
